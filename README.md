# Realtime-Temperature-Prediction-
I am predicting the current temperature using the Random Forest model, storing the values in InfluxDB (TimeSeries Database), and visualising them on the Grafana Dashboard.

1st:-
run the influxdb server and connect to local host 8086.
login.

2nd:-
run the grafana server and connect to local host port 3000.
login.

3rd:-
Train the model by running the randomforest.ipynb file.

4th:-
now run the the storevalrt.ipynb and predictrt.ipynb.

5th:-
Now you can just set up your dashboard with visualisations.
